# What Does The Philosopher Say?

[[OPEN AI ASSISTED]] (Is there an Awesome icon for this yet?)


No no, this is not What Does the Fox say project 

But instead, What would a Philosopher say? 

The idea of the project is to make the public more aware and cognizant of philosophical tools (what I refer to as actionable items in the world of philosophy)
that can be applied. 

### REAL LIFE EXAMPLES

Say you don't know much about a topic. And you engage in some meaningful conversation. Okay sir, I engage in a conversation, now what? 
Well, Philosophy is a study of the mind and more importantly the structures that one creates and formulates to be able to reason about the world around them. 

So even without having extensive knowledge for example of how HuggingFace transformers library's Llama model works on a Ryzen 6969 69TB RAM Machine, you can still reason about GPT-4 and its proposed outputs. After all, we are getting to a stage when AI is not merely a deployable microservice but instead an actual Co-pilot in our next wave of businesses whatever they may be


I think AI powered businesses will look a lot more subtle overall. For example I do see a world where in you start to question whether everything you are doing was influenced by AI in some way or other. 



### Why did you not just create a Poe Chatbot?

I could've; but chose not to. It's not like I am some ultimate coding jedi or anything like that but yes, I have always grown up fascinated by open source projects and contributing back into them would be a dream come true.

### Are there any plans to extend this to test output of other Chatbots?

Yes, hence the OpenAIClient code is refactored out in a separate library.

### Why isn't this Web3.0 Cryptoenabled Ethereum assisted Javascript 2199 compatible code yet?
I don't know.

### All this is nonsense talk, what does your project actually do?

Glad you asked. This project does one thing and one thing only. It will take your prompt as mentioned in the UI screenshots (TODO)

Then it will query GPT-3 model while asking it to apply 
1. Hermenutics
2. Dilectic
3. Socratic method
4. Logical inference
5. Others (don't know much philosophy myself)

If we capture all the different available philosophical retorts into a variable called "philosophy_tools"

Then the prompt you enter will basically become "Apply {philosophy_tool X} on {your prompt}"

This will enable the LLM to speak in a structured tone no matter what you ask it. 

Results will be silly but at the same time, expensive, so tread carefully.

What you need: 
1. OpenAI Account
2. OpenAI Api key that you set as an environment variable called "OPENAI_API_KEY"
